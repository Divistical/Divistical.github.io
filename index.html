    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> Hello there! My name is Dae Hoon Chung and I am an aspiring entrepreneur and developer! Born in 2004 on the island of Guam, I have traveled multiple times across different countries to end up here in the heart of Los Angeles. Currently, I am majoring in Mathematics and Economics with a Specialization in Computing and Data Science Engineering. Although this is the tip of the iceberg of what I wish to learn, that is something that I am finding on my own. Over the years I have spent in mathematics learning algorithms, real analysis, stochastic processes, linear algebra, optimization, and ML, I have begun to develop quite the interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. One day, I hope to be skilled enough to develop a software that is significant enough that it will fund my other businesses and allow me to retire, but that is just a dream. Please reach out to me if you have any inquiries or want to talk as I would love to get to meet you! </p>

    <p> If you have anything you would like to build together, feel free to reach out! </p>
